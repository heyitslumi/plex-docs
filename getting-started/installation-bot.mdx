<Note>
**Before you continue this guide, please keep in mind:**
Most bot hosting providers have different user interfaces and control panels. 

This guide will provide you general instructions, such as uploading files, editing the config, etc, but you may need to adapt the steps to match your panel's layout and features. Usually most of them use Pterodactyl, so there's not really a big difference.

This guide will use the [Nova theme](https://getnova.zip) (depending on who contributes to this), but you must adapt the steps to your panel. Thanks! :D
</Note>

To install Plex Development products (or really most node.js apps) in a Bot Hosting or in Pterodactyl, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Acquire a server" stepNumber="0" titleSize="h3">
    If you already bought a server, or made a Node.JS server in Pterodactyl, you can skip this step and go straight to Step 1.

    In order to use our products (for production), you must first buy a server from a hosting provider. Mostly they advertise it as either Bot Hosting, or Generic Languages servers, but make sure they support Node.JS, as that's what Plex's products are based on. 
    If you need help choosing a provider, this documentation has a dedicated page for recommended hosts, you can access it by clicking [here](https://docs.plexdevelopment.net/frequently-asked-questions/recommended-hosts).

    For contributors or myself: The page hasn't been made yet, so I just linked it to the official documentation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload the bot files" stepNumber="1" titleSize="h3">
    After you are inside the panel, locate a tab that either says Files or File Manager. 

    I CANT DO THIS ANYMORE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
