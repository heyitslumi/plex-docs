Plex Development products have specific system requirements and dependencies that must be met for optimal use. This guide explains which dependencies you will need and how to install them on your server.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

For all Plex Development products, the following system requirements must be met:
* Node.js 20.x.x LTS or above
* A hosting (VPS, dedicated server, etc.) with at least 512MB of RAM and 1 CPU core
* A text editor (like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.) for editing configuration files
* A stable Internet connection for downloading dependencies
* All NPM packages listed in the package.json (automatically installed with `npm install`)
<Warning>
The use of **Replit**, **Heroku**, **Glitch**, or any other similar free hosting platforms is strictly prohibited. These platforms often make the code publicly available, which violates the Terms of Service. If you decide to upload the code to these platforms, you may have your license revoked if the code is made public.
</Warning>

## ⏳ Installation

    <Warning>
    Installing dependencies on Windows is generally not recommended, due to how closed the system is. We recommend using a Linux-based system for better compatibility and performance, or using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to run a Linux environment on Windows.
