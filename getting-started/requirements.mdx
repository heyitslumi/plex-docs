Plex Development products have specific system requirements and dependencies that must be met for optimal use. This guide explains which dependencies you will need and how to install them on your server.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

For all Plex Development products, the following system requirements must be met:
* Node.js 20.x.x LTS or above
* A hosting (VPS, dedicated server, etc.) with at least 512MB of RAM and 1 CPU core
* A text editor (like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.) for editing configuration files
* A stable Internet connection for downloading dependencies
* All NPM packages listed in the package.json (automatically installed with `npm install`)
<Warning>
The use of **Replit**, **Heroku**, **Glitch**, or any other similar free hosting platforms is strictly prohibited. These platforms often make the code publicly available, which violates the Terms of Service. If you decide to upload the code to these platforms, you may have your license revoked if the code is made public.
</Warning>

## ⏳ Installation

The following steps will depend on which operating system you are using. Please select the appropriate section below:

    <Warning>
    Installing dependencies on Windows is generally not recommended, due to how closed the system is. We recommend using a Linux-based system for better compatibility and performance, or using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to run a Linux environment on Windows.

    In order to run Plex Development products on Windows, you will need to install the following dependencies:
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Install Visual Studio Desktop Development C++">
        This step is required to compile native modules used by some NPM packages we use. You can use this [link](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/91eb407f8418235d51c72b6a8df9c454ba882554/README.md#on-windows) to install the required components.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Install Node.js LTS">
        Download and install the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version of Node.js directly from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Install Build Tools">
        This step is required to compile native modules used by some NPM packages we use. Open an administrative Command Prompt and run the following command to install the necessary build tools:
        ```cmd
        npm install --global --production --vs2018 --add-python-to-path windows-build-tools
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Verify Installation">
        Open a new Command Prompt and run the following commands to verify that Node.js and NPM are installed correctly:
        ```cmd
        node -v
        npm -v
        ```
        If both commands return version numbers, the installation was successful.
