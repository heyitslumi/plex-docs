<Warning>Because of how both Windows and Linux work differently, the installation steps have been split into 2 seperate pages. Please choose which operating system you are using using the cards below:</Warning>

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Windows Installation" icon="windows" href="/getting-started/installation-windows" arrow="true" cta="Click here">
    Follow these steps to install Plex Development products on Windows.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Linux Installation" icon="linux" href="/getting-started/installation-linux" arrow="true" cta="Click here">
    Follow these steps to install Plex Development products on Linux.
  </Card>
</Columns>

The 2 pages may be combined in the future, but for now, they are here to make my life easier.
